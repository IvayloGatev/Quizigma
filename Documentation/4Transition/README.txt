The purpose in this phase is to ensure that the software is ready for delivery to users.

There are objectives for the Transition phase that help you to fine-tune functionality, performance, and overall quality of the beta product from the end of the previous phase [KRO03]:

1. Beta test to validate that user expectations are met. 
	This typically requires some fine-tuning activities, such as 	bug-fixing and making enhancements for performance and 	usability.

2. Achieve stakeholder concurrence that deployment is complete. 
	This may involve various levels of tests for product 	acceptance, including formal and informal tests and beta 	tests.

3. Improve future project performance through lessons learned. 	Document lessons learned and improve the process and tool 	environment for the project.

Key considerations

	The Transition phase can include running old and new systems 	in parallel, migrating data, training users, and adjusting 	business processes.

	The number of iterations in the Transition phase varies from 	one iteration for a simple system requiring primarily minor 	bug fixing, to many iterations for a complex system, involving 	addition of features and performing activities to make the 	business transition from using the old system to using the new 	system.

	When the Transition phase objectives are met, the project can 	be closed. For some products, the end of the current project 	lifecycle may coincide with the beginning of the next 	lifecycle, leading to the next generation of the same product.
