The purpose of this phase is to mitigate technical and non-technical risks. Technical risks are typically addressed by establishing the baseline of an executable architecture of the system and providing a stable basis for the bulk of the development effort in the next phase. Non-technical risks are addressed by delivering key capabilities in close collaboration with stakeholders, allowing us to answer questions such as:

- Does stakeholder A concur with the usage paradigm as implemented by the first delivered scenarios?
- Can we leverage this open source component?
- Can we acquire this commercial component?
- Do we have personnel with the appropriate competency?
- Have we validated that the team can collaborate effectively to deliver working software?

There are objectives for the Elaboration phase that help you address risks associated with requirements, architecture, costs, and schedule, among others:  

1. Get a more detailed understanding of the requirements. 
	Having a good understanding of the majority of requirements 	allows you to create a more accurate plan and to get buy-in 	from stakeholders. Be sure to gain an in-depth understanding 	of the most critical requirements to be validated by the 	architecture. This does not mean that every use case needs to 	be detailed, but that you have detailed key use cases, and 	understand remaining use cases well enough to size them.

2. Design, implement, validate, and establish the baseline for the architecture. 
	Design, implement, and test a skeleton structure of the system 	by designing, implementing, and testing a small number of 	critical scenarios. Although the functionality is not complete 	yet, most of the interfaces between the building blocks are 	implemented and tested, and the type of architecture and 	required architectural mechanisms are identified. This result 	is referred as an executable architecture.

3. Mitigate essential risks, and produce accurate schedule and cost estimates. 
	Many technical risks are addressed as a result of detailing 	the requirements and of designing, implementing, and testing 	the architecture. You may also have to address non-technical 	risks, such as legal and financial issues related to usage of 	open source or commercial components. Refine and detail the 	high-level project plan.
