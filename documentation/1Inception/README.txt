- First step is to develop a vision of the project.

- Read and understand task “Develop Technical Vision” (OpenUP) in detail.

- Next step is to get an understanding of the requirements.

- Read and understand task “Identify and Refine Requirements” (OpenUP).

- When you have read this you may have noticed, that the OpenUP suggests to develop use cases in order to get an understanding of the required behaviour of the system under development. This is a very good idea, but it requires a lot of work (see: "use case specification" in Examples of the OpenUP description. See also: slides "Requirements Engineering" of module "Software Engineering" ).

- Scrum uses another - more agile - approach: user stories. You may find a description of writing user stories here.

REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATIONS:
Deliverables:
- Product Backlog containing a preliminary list prioritized User Stories (PDF)
